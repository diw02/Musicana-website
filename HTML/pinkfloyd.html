            <p>Pink Floyd is a legendary rock band that formed in London, England in 1965. They are widely 
                regarded as one of the most influential and innovative groups in the history of rock music, 
                known for their distinctive sound and elaborate live performances.</p>

            <p>The band's original lineup consisted of singer and guitarist Syd Barrett, bassist Roger Waters, 
                keyboardist Richard Wright, drummer Nick Mason, and guitarist and vocalist David Gilmour, who 
                joined the band in 1968 after Barrett's departure.<span id = "releases"></span></p>

            <br>
            <p>Gaining an early following as one of the first British psychedelic groups, they were distinguished 
                by their extended compositions, philosophical lyrics, sonic experimentation and elaborate live shows. 
                Their albums "The Piper at the Gates of Dawn" and "A Saucerful of Secrets" were both critical and 
                commercial successes, but the band's popularity exploded with the release of their 1973 album 
                "The Dark Side of the Moon", which spent a record-breaking 937 weeks on the Billboard 200 chart.</p>

            <p>The popular album which had a picture of a prism refracting light on a black background and was 
                known for its hypnotic melodies and its haunting, philosophical lyrics featured many otherworldly 
                songs such as "Time" and "Breathe (In the Air)".</p>

            <p>Over the course of their career, Pink Floyd continued to push the boundaries of rock music, 
                experimenting with complex concept albums, multimedia performances, and avant-garde soundscapes. 
                Some of their other notable albums include "Wish You Were Here", "Animals", and "The Wall."<span id = "awards"></span></p>

            <br>
            <p>Pink Floyd has received a lot of awards for their incredible tracks such as the Grammy award for 
                the "Best Rock Instrumental Performance" in 1995 which was given to the song "Marooned" from the 
                1994 album "The Division Bell" and has been nominated for many more such as the Album of the Year 
                for "The Wall" in the 1981 Grammys.</p>
            
            <p>Despite numerous lineup changes and personal conflicts, Pink Floyd remained active and 
                influential until their official breakup in 1995. The band's legacy continues to be felt in 
                popular music and culture, and they are widely regarded as one of the greatest and most 
                innovative rock bands of all time.</p>
